To be fair: If you're a C# developer, the syntax of both PowerShell and F# might appear odd to you at a first glance. And because you know your beloved C# very well, you tend to master even tasks in it, which would be a perfect fit for a small script instead of a full-blown console application (*). 

At least if you are like me, I did it this way for years. Until I started to finally manage to learn F# and the core concepts of functional programming. 

I have still a long way to go there, and as my main programming language will be C# for the foreseeable future (at least in most projects), I am now looking for problems small and isolated enough to be be solved with F#. 

Automating small tasks seems to be a good fit as there often are no or only few dependencies and the resulting programs are small enough to easily be replaced if something doesn't work out as expected.

## The Power Of .NET

With F# you benefit from the full base class library you know and love as a .NET developer. You can use everything that comes with .NET/Mono, and of course every library that's available (e.g. via NuGet), too. All of this is available in F# scripts as well.

## Development Speed

What's really cool about F#, if you're coming from C#, is [F# Interactive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/): 

> F# Interactive (fsi.exe) is used to run F# code interactively at the console, or to execute F# scripts. In other words, F# interactive executes a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print Loop) for the F# language.

This means you don't have to run a fat console application every time you want to check a small code-change, just send it to the REPL and see what happens. This leads to a massive increase in productivity, as debug cycles become so much shorter. 

So you end up in a (with the [editor](http://ionide.io/) or [IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) of your choice) quickly hacked solution to your problem, save it as F# Script, e.g. _MyTask.fsx_, and execute it this way:

```
fsharpi MyTask.fsx
```

This will start F# interactive and execute your script immediately.

And if you have to debug something later on: Open the script, select the part you want to execute and send it to the REPL. Repeat.

## Execution Speed

What you will notice while running a script with F# interactive is the short time it needs to start up. Compared to other tools (e.g. Bash scripts), this obviously sucks.

But there's help. F# scripts are easily compilable, so you can skip F# interactive at runtime and execute them directly:

```
fsharpc MyTask.fsx
```

This will result in a _MyTask.exe_ which you then can run directly (on macOS or Linux make sure to call it via _mono_) and which will execute _much faster_.

## Bonus Points: Set An Alias For Your Script

This is not directly related to scripting with F#, but I will append it here so I can google it later whenever I won't remember the correct steps ;-).

If you have to run your script manually and repeatedly, setting up a shortcut seems appropriate. Let's say you just want to call `mytask` instead if `mono MyTask.exe`. Here is what to do.

First of all, add a `mytask.sh` and place it next to your .exe:

```
#!/bin/bash

mono "$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )/MyTask.exe"
```

Than make this bash script executable: `chmod +x mytask.sh`. Open Vim with `vi ~/.bash_profile` and press `i`, so you can add the alias for your script: `alias mytask='{FullPath}/mytask.sh'`. Next quit Vim with `ESC` and `:wq` and apply the changes you just made with `source ~/.bash_profile`.

That's it, happy executing!
