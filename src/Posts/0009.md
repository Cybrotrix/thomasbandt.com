## Endless Use Cases

Think of:

- Disabling features that are not completely ready before publishing a new release
- Disabling features that don't work as expected in production
- Enabling features only for some selected users (A/B testing)
- Enabling features depending on purchased license
- ...

## Get Started

The idea behind Feature Toggles is nothing new and has been [described by Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) more than four years ago for example. There are also tons of libraries out there, for example [FeatureSwitcher](https://github.com/mexx/FeatureSwitcher) (see the alternatives list there, too).

But to get things started, you don't need a more or less complex library. All what's needed, is ...

### An Interface To Mark Your Features

	public interface IFeature { }

### An Object That Holds The Information Whether A Feature Is Enabled Or Not

    public class FeatureToggle<T> where T : IFeature
    {
        public bool Enabled { get; private set; }

        public FeatureToggle(bool enabled)
        {
            Enabled = enabled;
        }
    }

### A Place To Register All Your Features

    public static class FeatureToggleRegistry
    {
        public static List<object> Features { get; private set; }

        static FeatureToggleRegistry()
        {
            Features = new List<object>();
        }

        public static void Add<T>(bool enabled) where T : IFeature
        {
            Features.Add(new FeatureToggle<T>(enabled));
        }

        public static bool ContainsEnabled<T>() where T : IFeature
        {
            var feature = Features
                .FirstOrDefault(f => f.GetType() == typeof(FeatureToggle<T>))
                as FeatureToggle<T>;

            return feature != null && feature.Enabled;
        }
    }

### Something That Tells You Whether A Specific Feature Can Be Used And Executed

    public static class Feature
    {
        public static bool IsEnabled<T>() where T : IFeature
        {
            return FeatureToggleRegistry.ContainsEnabled<T>();
        }
    }

## That's All

To be honest, you could of course simplify it even a bit more, for example by merging Feature and FeatureToggleRegistry. But I like the clarity of that separated objects.

However, all you need to do now is to find a starting point in your application to register your features, for example the AppDelegate object in an iOS app.

	public class BlueController : UIViewController, IFeature
	{
	}

	// ...

	FeatureToggleRegistry.Add<BlueController>(false);

	// ...

	if (Feature.IsEnabled<BlueController>())
	{
		PresentViewController(new BlueController(), true, null);
	}
	else
	{
		PresentViewController(new RedController(), true, null);
	}
