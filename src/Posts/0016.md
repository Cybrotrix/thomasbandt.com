![Some impressions](https://thomasbandt.com/upload/devwalk2015.jpg)

As I wrote [recently](https://thomasbandt.com/join-me-at-developer-open-space-2015-in-leipzig),
I am not the guy you're likely to meet at a commercial tech conference. And even
going to community conferences has become something like a class reunion to me,
as there's always a core of people I am happy to meet and drink some beer with
at those events.

So a couple of years ago an idea was born at one of those events, or more
precisely while hanging around in a bar afterwards: Why shouldn't we meet without
an official reason? Simply walking somewhere, talking about tech and
less important stuff, and having some fun together.

In June Sebastian announced it officially at his [blog](http://blog.cayas.de/die-idee-des-developer-walk) (in German),
so we only needed a place and a date to make it happen. Unfortunately none of us
had time over the summer, so Sebastian set up a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/qc7tr96r/developer-walk), which –
promoted via Twitter – quickly became the central place for some discussions and
decision-making.

We didn't know how many people would make it, because Dresden, located in East
Germany only 100 km from Poland, meant to be some long journeys, but eventually
we had 13 attendees. Which was great when recalling the self-organizing
character of that event.

We met in the morning at the Elbe river, took an original steamboat from the
1920's to a little city called Rathen and then climbed up the "Bastei", a
beautiful and world-famous place with a tremendous view you may probably know
from one of the Windows 7 wallpapers. Altogether more than
9 hours of geek-talk, good food, and even some "sports". And of course it
did end at the hotel bar ;-).

I think we were all part of the proof of concept of a new community format which
will be repeated for sure in 2016. See you there.
